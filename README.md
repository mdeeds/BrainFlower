This course is aimed to teach concepts of Machine Learning and
Artificial Intelligence.

## Milestone 1

* Write Processing code to draw a top-down view of your robot.

* Check in or otherwise add this code to the Git repository.  

* View your robot (and others!) in your web browser.

## Milestone 2

* Play the game by driving the example robot around with the keyboard

* Write a function to drive your robot without the arrow keys.

* Use the sensor input to guide your robot.

* Compete your robot against yourself with the keyboard

## Milestone 3

* Compete your robot against the basic implementation and against
  robots designed by your classmates.

* Improve your algorithm

## Milestone 4

* Add a one-layer neural network to drive your robot.

* Adjust "reward" and "anxiety" parameters.

* Check in your trained network.

## Milestone 5

* Build an auto-encoder.

* Train your auto-encoder by driving with the keyboard.

## Milestone 6

* Add your trained auto-encoder in front of the one layer network

* Train this new network and compare with the result of the neural net alone.

## Milestone 7

* Train an auto-encoder using a convolutional neural network

## Milestone 8
