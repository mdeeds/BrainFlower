    Select two robots. The robot on the left is the robot which you are using
    to train your net. THe robot on the right is its opponent. Click "collect"
    a few times to collect training data. Click "train" to apply that training
    data to the net. You can select the 10x or 100x multipliers to effectively
    click these buttons a lot of times.

    I recommend collecting 10-100 games and
    training in cycles of 1-10. Training can take a long time
  </div>
  <div>
    When your robot is trained, you can head over to
    "<a href="play.html">play.html</a>" to see it in action. Your net is saved
    in your browser. You can turn off your computer and come back to it - it
    will still be there. You can't share your net or check it into the source
    repository (yet).
