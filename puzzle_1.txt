<p>Welcome to BrainFlower Journey!  The blue robot's brain is defined in the
code on this page.  If you see something like 
<span contenteditable>this</span> it is code you can edit.  You need to edit
this code to make the robot win the challenge.  

<p>To win, your robot, the blue one, must collect more flowers than the opponent.
In this challenge your opponent won't move, so you just need to get the flower.

<p>Once you have won this challenge, you can proceed to the next one.  Go ahead
and give it a try!

function run(s) {
