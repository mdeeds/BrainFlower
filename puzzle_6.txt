title:
Stealing Flowers

opponent:
MattBot

instructions:
<p>If our robot bumps into the back of the opponent, it will steal a flower.
The <span class="code">opponentAngle</span> sensor tells us the angle from
us to the opponent.  If we are headed straight at the opponent, the sensor will
be zero.  If the opponent is directly right, it will be 90.

<p>The opponent is rarely within 1 degree of straight ahead of us, so we need
to make this smaller by dividing it by something.

code:
function run(s) {
  return s.opponentAngle / (= 2 =);
}

goal:
-1
